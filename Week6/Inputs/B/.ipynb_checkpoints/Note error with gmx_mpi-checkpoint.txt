I initially only ran the GROMACS simulations for alanine dipeptide A before the HPC Greene maintenance shutdown. However, when I tried to run this for alanine dipeptide B, I encountered the following error: 

“gmx_mpi: error while loading shared libraries: libhwloc.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory”

I am wondering if there is an error with the loading gromacs via "source /scratch/work/courses/CHEM-GA-2671-2023fa/software/gromacs-2019.6-plumedSept2020/bin/GMXRC.bash.modules”. In the meantime, I am using the outputs from Rui for the analysis portion.
