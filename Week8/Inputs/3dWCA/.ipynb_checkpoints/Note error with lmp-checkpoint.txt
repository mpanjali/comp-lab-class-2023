I initially only ran the LAMMPS simulations for 2d WCA system before the HPC Greene maintenance shutdown. However, when I tried to run this for 3d WCA system, I encountered the following error: 

"lmp: error while loading shared libraries: libjpeg.so.62: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

I am wondering if there is an error with the loading lammps via "source /scratch/work/courses/CHEM-GA-2671-2023fa/software/lammps-gcc-30Oct2022/setup_lammps.bash‚Äù. In the meantime, I am using the outputs from Rui for the analysis portion.
